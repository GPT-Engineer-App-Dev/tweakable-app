I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide audio files. However, I can guide you on how to add an existing notification sound file to your project.

1. Obtain a notification sound file in MP3 format. You can either create one using audio editing software or download a free one from a website that offers royalty-free sounds.

2. Once you have the "notification.mp3" file, place it in the `public/sounds` directory of your project.

3. Ensure your project structure looks something like this:
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── public/
   │   ├── sounds/
   │   │   └── notification.mp3
   │   └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

4. To play the sound when a button is clicked, you can use JavaScript. Here is an example of how you might do it:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Notification Sound</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <button id="notifyButton">Click me</button>
       <audio id="notificationSound" src="public/sounds/notification.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>

       <script>
           document.getElementById('notifyButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
               document.getElementById('notificationSound').play();
           });
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

This HTML file includes a button that, when clicked, plays the notification sound. Make sure the path to the MP3 file is correct relative to your HTML file.
